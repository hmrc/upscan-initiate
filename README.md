# upscan-initiate

Microservice for initiating the upload of files created externally to HMRC estate. These could be from members of the public or third-party services.
This service is not for transfer of files from one HMRC service to another. See the Transmission Service as documented in Confluence for this use-case.

# Upscan user manual

## Introduction

Please also read the Upscan documentation in Confluence, this is in the "Platform Services" space.

In this "user manual" the collection of microservices that make up Upscan are discussed, not just `upscan-initiate`. This documentation is here as `upscan-initiate` is the microservice which developers will interact with directly.

The Upscan service allows consuming services to orchestrate the uploading of files. Upscan provides
temporary storage of the uploaded file, ensures that the file isn't harmful (doesn't contain viruses) and verifies against predefined restrictions provided by the consuming service (e.g. file type & file size).
Once the upload URL has been requested, upload and verification of a file are performed asynchronously without the involvement of the consuming service.

## File upload workflow

* Consuming service requests upload of a single file. It makes a HTTP POST call to the `/upscan/initiate` endpoint with details of the requested upload (including a callback URL and optional file size constraints)
* Upscan service replies with a template of the HTTP POST form that will be used to upload the file. A unique file reference is also provided to allow the consuming service to correlate the upload request with notifications to the callback URL provided
* Consuming service passes the form details to the end-user, either via a control on a webpage or to an internal/external service which will upload the file
* The end user uploads the file
* Upscan service performs all checks on the uploaded file
* If file the file passes all checks, a notification is sent as a POST request to a consuming service. This notification contains the URL to GET the file from
* Consuming service downloads the file using provided URL or passes this URL on to another service which will make use of the file location
* After specified time, the file is automatically removed from the remote storage. Upscan does NOT keep files indefinitely
* If the file fails a check, a notification is sent to the consuming service containing information on the failed check. The file is unavailable for retrieval
* If the consuming service fails to respond to the callback request (e.g. the consuming service is down, the consuming service answered with an HTTP status code other than 2xx), the callback will be retried up to a maximum of 30 retries. The time interval between the retries is 60 seconds
Configuration of these values is here (https://github.com/hmrc/upscan-infrastructure/blob/master/modules/sqs/main.tf)

## Service usage

### Whitelisting

In order to initiate an upload the consuming service must be whitelisted by upscan-initiate. See the 'Whitelisting client services' section further down in this document.

### Requesting a URL to upload to

Assuming the consuming service is whitelisted, it makes a POST request to the `/upscan/initiate` endpoint. This request includes details about the expected upload, specifically the callback URL and optional constraints on size.

The callback will be made from inside the MDTP environment. Hence, the callback URL should comprise the MDTP internal callback address and not the public domain address.

Here is an example of the request body:

```json
{
    "callbackUrl": "http://myservice.com/callback",
    "minimumFileSize" : 0,
    "maximumFileSize" : 1024
}
```

Meaning of parameters:

| Parameter name|Description|Required|
|--------------|-----------|--------|
|callbackUrl   |Url that will be called to report the outcome of file checking and upload, including retrieval details if successful. Notification format is detailed further down in this file.| yes|
|minimumFileSize|Minimum file size (in Bytes). Default is 0.|no|
|maximumFileSize|Maximum file size (in Bytes). Cannot be greater than 100MB. Default is 100MB.|no|

The request has to include the following HTTP headers:

| Header name|Description|Required|
|--------------|-----------|--------|
| User-Agent | Identifier of the service that calls upscan | yes |
| x-Session-ID | Identifier of the user's session | no  |
| x-Request-ID | Identifier of the user's request | yes |

Session-id / Request-id headers will be used to link the file with user's journey.

*Note:* If you are using `[http-verbs](https://github.com/hmrc/http-verbs)` to call Upscan, all the headers will be set automatically
(See: [HttpVerb.scala](https://github.com/hmrc/http-verbs/blob/2807dc65f64009bd7ce1f14b38b356e06dd23512/src/main/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/http/HttpVerb.scala#L53))

The service replies with a pre-filled template for the upload of the file (described below).
The JSON response also contains a globally unique file reference of the upload. This reference can be used by the Upscan service team to view the progress and result of the journey through the different Upscan components. The consuming service can use this reference to correlate the upload request with a successfully uploaded file.

```json
{
    "reference": "11370e18-6e24-453e-b45a-76d3e32ea33d",
    "uploadRequest": {
        "href": "https://bucketName.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com",
        "fields": {
            "Content-Type": "application/xml",
            "acl": "private",
            "key": "xxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx",
            "policy": "xxxxxxxx==",
            "x-amz-algorithm": "AWS4-HMAC-SHA256",
            "x-amz-credential": "ASIAxxxxxxxxx/20180202/eu-west-2/s3/aws4_request",
            "x-amz-date": "yyyyMMddThhmmssZ",
            "x-amz-meta-callback-url": "http://myservice.com/callback",
            "x-amz-signature": "xxxx"
        }
    }
}
```

### The file upload

In order to upload the file, the following form is sent as the body of a POST request:

```
<form method="POST" href="...value of the href from the response above...">
    <input type="hidden" name="x-amz-algorithm" value="AWS4-HMAC-SHA256">
    ... all the fields returned in "fields" map in the response above ...
    <input type="file" name="file"/> <- form field representing the file to upload
    <input type="submit" value="OK"/>
</form>
```

This POST request can be sent programmatically from backend code, by making an async call using AJAX or the submit of a web form.

Whichever way the form is sent, remember:

- You must use multipart encoding (`multipart/form-data`) NOT `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`. If you use` application/x-www-form-urlencoded`, AWS will return a response from which this error is not clear.
- The 'file' field must be the last field in the submitted form.

### File upload outcome

If the POST is not successful, the service will return a HTTP error code (4xx, 5xx). The response body will contain XML encoded details of the problem. See the Error handling section for details.

If the POST is successful, the service returns a HTTP 204 response with an empty body.

### File processing outcome

#### Success

When a file is successfully uploaded it is processed by [upscan-verify](https://github.com/hmrc/upscan-verify) to check for viruses & that it is of an allowed file type.

If these checks pass, the file is made for available for retrieval & the Upscan service will make a POST request to the URL specified as the 'callbackUrl' by the consuming service with the following body:

```json
{
    "reference" : "11370e18-6e24-453e-b45a-76d3e32ea33d",
    "fileStatus" : "READY",
    "downloadUrl" : "https://bucketName.s3.eu-west-2.amazonaws.com?1235676",
    "uploadDetails": {
        "uploadTimestamp": "2018-04-24T09:30:00Z",
        "checksum": "396f101dd52e8b2ace0dcf5ed09b1d1f030e608938510ce46e7a5c7a4e775100"
    }
}
```

Note the block entitled 'uploadDetails', see the Confluence page 'Upscan & Non-Repudiation Service' in the Platform Services space usage of this information:

- `uploadTimestamp` - The timestamp of the file upload
- `checksum` - The SHA256 hash of the uploaded file


#### Failure

The list of failure reasons is as follows:

- `QUARANTINED` - the file has failed virus scanning
- `REJECTED` - the file is not of an allowed file type
- `UNKNOWN` - there is some other problem with the file

These reasons form one of the following JSON responses sent to the callback URL:


```json
{
    "reference" : "11370e18-6e24-453e-b45a-76d3e32ea33d",
    "fileStatus" : "FAILED",
    "failureDetails": {
        "failureReason": "QUARANTINED",
        "message": "e.g. This file has a virus"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "reference" : "11370e18-6e24-453e-b45a-76d3e32ea33d",
    "fileStatus" : "FAILED",
    "failureDetails": {
        "failureReason": "REJECTED",
        "message": "MIME type $mime is not allowed for service $service-name"
    }
}
```

```json
{
    "reference" : "11370e18-6e24-453e-b45a-76d3e32ea33d",
    "fileStatus" : "FAILED",
    "failureDetails": {
        "failureReason": "UNKNOWN",
        "message": "Something unknown happened"
    }
}
```

You or the Upscan service team can use the unique file reference to find out more using the Upscan observability tools.

## Whitelisting client services

Any service using Upscan must be whitelisted. Please view the "Upscan & Consuming Services" page of the Upscan documentation in Confluence for the onboarding process. The team are also available on Slack [#team-plat-services](https://hmrcdigital.slack.com/messages/C705QD804).

Consuming services must identify themselves in requests via the `User-Agent` header. If the supplied value is not in Upscan's list of allowed services then the `/initiate` call will fail with a `403` error.

In addition to returning a `403` error, Upscan will log details of the Forbidden request. For example:

```json
{
    "app":"upscan-initiate",
    "message":"Invalid User-Agent: [Some(my-unknown-service-name)].",
    "logger":"application",
    "level":"WARN"
}
```

*Note:* If you are using `[http-verbs](https://github.com/hmrc/http-verbs)` to call Upscan, then the `User-Agent` header will be set automatically.
(See: [HttpVerb.scala](https://github.com/hmrc/http-verbs/blob/2807dc65f64009bd7ce1f14b38b356e06dd23512/src/main/scala/uk/gov/hmrc/http/HttpVerb.scala#L53))

## Error handling

This document indicates the responses from Upscan components, including error/failure cases.

The actual file upload is to an AWS endpoint and the responses come straight from AWS. These responses are documented here: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/API/ErrorResponses.html

## Design considerations

### Uploading multiple files
Upscan supports single file uploads. If a consuming service needs to upload multiple files during one user's journey, it must make multiple independent calls to upscan-initiate.

### Security
The callback URL provided by the service will be sent in plain text through the network and will be visible to anyone receiving or inspecting the upload request details.

Because of this, the URL must not:
- Point to a host that is accessible from outside MDTP.
- Contain sensitive data (e.g. user identifiers, session tokens, &c.)

### File metadata
Upscan intentionally doesn't allow consuming services to attach metadata or tags to the uploaded file. It is expected that the consuming service will use the globally unique file reference to correlate any file metadata to an successfully uploaded file when it is notified of the successful upload.

Upscan must not be used to route or transfer files between different services on MDTP - it is for files to be uploaded into the HMRC estate.

# Architecture of the service

Please see the Upscan Confluence page for architecture overview and details.

# Running and maintenance of the service

## Running locally

In order to run the service against one of HMRC AWS accounts {labs, live} it's necessary to have an AWS user with the proper role. See [UpScan Accounts/roles](https://github.com/hmrc/aws-users/blob/master/AccountLinks.md) for proper details.

Prerequisites:

- AWS user with correct roles & MFA enabled
- AWS credential configuration set up according to this document [aws-credential-configuration](https://github.com/hmrc/aws-users), with the credentials below:

```
[webops-users]
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::638924580364:mfa/YOUR_AWS_USER_NAME
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
output = json
region = eu-west-2

[upscan-labs-engineer]
source_profile = webops-users
role_arn = arn:aws:iam::063874132475:role/RoleServiceUpscanEngineer
mfa_serial = arn:aws:iam::638924580364:mfa/YOUR_AWS_USER_NAME
aws_access_key_id = YOUR_ACCESS_KEY_HERE
aws_secret_access_key = YOUR_SECRET_KEY_HERE
output = json
region = eu-west-2
```
- Python 2.7 installed
- Botocore and awscli python modules installed locally:
  - Linux:

		```
		sudo pip install botocore
		sudo pip install awscli
		```

  - Mac (Mac has issues with pre-installed version of ```six``` as discussed [here](https://github.com/pypa/pip/issues/3165) ):

		```
		sudo pip install botocore --ignore-installed six
		sudo pip install awscli --ignore-installed six
		```

In order to run the app against the lab environment it's necessary to run the following commands:

```
export AWS_S3_BUCKET_INBOUND=name of inbound s3 bucket you would like to use
export AWS_DEFAULT_PROFILE=name of proper profile in ~/.aws/credentials file
./aws-profile sbt
```
These commands will give you an access to SBT shell where you can run the service using 'run' or 'start' commands.
